## Interpretation

The heterozygous SCN2A variant c.1234G>A (p.Arg412His) was identified as a
confirmed de novo event. The variant is absent from population databases,
located in a critical functional domain, and consistent with the patient’s
phenotype.

Based on ACMG/AMP criteria (PS2, PM2, PM1, PP3, PP4), this variant is classified
as Likely Pathogenic.
