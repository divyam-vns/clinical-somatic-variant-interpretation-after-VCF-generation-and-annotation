# Clinical Variant Interpretation Pipeline

This pipeline supports trio-based clinical interpretation of SNVs/indels
following variant calling. It integrates automated filtering with mandatory
human curation checkpoints per ACMG/AMP and CAP/CLIA standards.

Automation assists interpretation; final classification requires human review.
